# Hotel Menu Project<br>
**Overview**: Your project is a hotel menu application designed to help users select items from a menu and calculate the total cost. 
It uses Pythonâ€™s conditional statements (if/else) and dictionaries to manage the menu items and their prices.

## Features
- **Menu Display**: Shows a list of available menu items along with their prices.
- **Order Processing**: Allows users to select items from the menu.
- **Total Calculation**: Computes the total cost of the selected items.

 ## Menu Items<br>
The menu includes the following items:<br>
- Pizza
- Burger
- Coffee
- Salad
- Pasta

## Usage<br>
Run the main script to start the program. The script will display the menu, prompt the user to enter their order, and then calculate and display the total cost.

## How It Works:<br>
**Display Menu**: The application starts by displaying the menu to the user.<br>

**Get Order** : The user is prompted to enter the items they want to order.
                The application uses a loop to allow multiple entries until the user indicates they are done.<br>

**Validate Selection** : For each item entered, the application checks if it is on the menu.
                        If it is, the item is added to the order; if not, the user is prompted to enter a valid item.<br>

**Calculate Total** : After the user has finished ordering, the application sums up the prices of the selected items to calculate the total cost.<br>

**Display Total** : The total cost is displayed to the user.<br>
